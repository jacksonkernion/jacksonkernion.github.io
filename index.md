I do a mix of interface design, data collection, and data analysis for [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com)'s human feedback program. The ultimate goal is to use human feedback data to make large language models better-align with human intention, without causing harm.

As an academic, I studied philosophy of mind, epistemology, and philosophy of science. My work focused on cognitive architecture () and the methodology of cognitive science. I taught a philosophy of mind intro course at MIT during the Spring 2020 term, after receiving my PhD from UC Berkeley.

I procastinated in grad school by building [tools](/tools) for academics.

I occasionally write [posts](posts/I-Blew-The-Whistle-On-John-Searle.html)
