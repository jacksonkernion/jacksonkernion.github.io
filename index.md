I'm a recent UC Berkeley Philosophy PhD, working in philosophy of mind, epistemology, and philosophy of science. I'm visiting MIT during the Spring 2020 term.

I argue in my dissertation that our concept of consciousness is a *functional* concept. This stands in opposition to the conventional view that thinking of the mind in a first-personal, how-it-feels way is distinct from thinking of the mind in a third-personal, scientific way. The goal is to articulate the conceptual foundations that make a science of consciousness possible.

I graduated from Harvard in 2012 with a philosophy degree in the interdisciplinary Mind, Brain, and Behavior program.

I keep up a coding hobby by building [tools](/tools) for academics. And I enjoy the friendly competition of strategy-based [board](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan) [games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders).
