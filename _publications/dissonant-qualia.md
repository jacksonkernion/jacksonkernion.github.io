description: "Dissonant qualia cases ask: are structure-*distorting* phenomenal quality transformations conceptually compatible with the same underlying functional architecture? At least some of them aren't, and that shows that some phenomenal kinds (e.g. color experience, emotion, audition) conceptually necesitate matching functional kinds. (c.f. the structure-preserving transformations of inverted qualia cases.)"
