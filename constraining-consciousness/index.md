# Constraining Consciousness

I like to work on ~6-week-long schedules. I created this page on April 24. By May 31, I want add PDFs of all the parts of 'the book' that I think of as close-enough-to-done-to-share. As of right now, I expect that to be:

- 00 - Preface
- 01 - Strange Experience
- 02 - The Specter of Phenomenal Overflow
- 03 - Making Room for Modest Conceptual Functionalism

With a few other 'scraps' that I think of as necessarily part of any book:

- Dissonant Qualia
- Objections to Modest Conceptual Functionalism
- [My zombie argument reply]

I've realized that I have to think of this thing as a book, because that's the only way I can properly motivate myself. (I'm excited for the website launch of the thing, not publication an article in some journal.) And so I will have to backsolve for articles after I write the imagined-to-be-a-book-chapter versions. (I'll deal with the ickiness of that idea in a different 6-week arc.)
