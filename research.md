<p class="page-description">I’m writing a dissertation on the concept of conscious  experience, arguing that the ‘first-personal’, phenomenal aspects of the mind cannot be <em>conceptually</em> divorced from certain ‘third-personal’, functional aspects of the mind. In jargon form: that a mental state is p-conscious a priori entails that that state is a-conscious.</p>

<p class="item-title">Strange Experience: Why Experience Without Access Makes No Sense</p>

<p>I introduce a challenge to the view that thinking about minds in a first-personal, how-it-feels way is cleanly separable from thinking about minds in a third-personal, how-it-works way. To show this, I discuss the ‘contrapositive’ of widely-discussed zombie cases: phenomenology without function (rather than function without phenomenology.)</p>

<p class="item-title">The Mental Measurement Problem: The Frictionless Epistemology of Conceptual Dualism</p>

<p>I try to show how a conceptual gap between first-personal data and third-personal data about the mind leads to insurmountable methodological difficulties for a science of mind.</p>
