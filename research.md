I’m writing a dissertation on the concept of conscious  experience, arguing that the 'first-personal', phenomenal aspects of the mind cannot be *conceptually* divorced from certain 'third-personal', functional aspects of the mind. In jargon form: that a mental state is p-conscious a priori entails that that state is a-conscious.

Take my Strange Experience Survey to log your intuitions about my central test case (and see the current results).

**Strange Experience**

I introduce a challenge to the view that thinking about minds in a first-personal, how-it-feels way is cleanly separable from thinking about minds in a third-personal, how-it-works way. To show this, I discuss the ‘contrapositive’ of widely-discussed zombie cases: phenomenology without function (rather than function without phenomenology.)

**The Mental Measurement Problem**

I try to show how a conceptual gap between first-personal data and third-personal data about the mind leads to insurmountable methodological difficulties for a science of mind.
