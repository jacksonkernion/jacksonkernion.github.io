# Dissertation

Philosophers regularly commit themselves to a conceptual distinction between phenomenal experience and functional structure. As the thought goes, you can’t learn anything about an organism’s cognitive architecture just by learning about whether/what that organism feels, and vice versa.

But this is a mistake. It generates a series of unsatisfying, intractable debates, and creates insurmountable methodological difficulties for a science of consciousness. We can’t make sense of experiences *as experiences* unless they meet certain functional constraints. This much can be demonstrated by considering test cases that keep the phenomenal facts fixed while zeroing out or altering the functional facts. Such cases are a kind of inversion of the classic absent qualia and inverted qualia thought experiments. The result is a modest form of conceptual functionalism that reconciles competing dualist and physicalist intuitions.

While I mostly focus on conceptual issues in my dissertation (where I argue that minds, in general, are integrated systems which unify disparate phenomenal states), my preferred conceptual conclusions naturally lead to future work that lies at the intersection of philosophy and science--work that goes about the task of constructing a model of the contingent architecture of human minds that conforms to the a priori constraints laid out in my dissertation. Here, I'm most interested in showing that we can't specify a general 'thinking module' over and above the collection task-specific modules: 'thinking' is just the ebb and flow of outputs that are dumped into a single global workspace.
