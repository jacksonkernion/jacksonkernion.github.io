	    dissertation: "Experience and the Structural Lens"
	    note: "How does our concept of conscious experience guide and constrain our attempts to understand the mind’s place in nature? If we endorse a wide conceptual gap between experience and the natural world, we risk being unable to justify everyday judgments, and we risk making any metaphysics of mind unintelligible—or so I argue. Instead, I try to show: a) how we must already be committed to a certain (albeit limited) conceptual connection between conscious experience and its functional structure, and b) how that commitment ought to shape our enquiry into the nature of conscious experience."
