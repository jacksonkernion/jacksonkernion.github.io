# Teaching Tools & Materials

I grade student papers anonymously using a simple online tool I built, [Paper Grader](http://papergrader.org/demo).

I create interactive practice problems for my logic students at [deductivelogic.org](http://deductivelogic.org/psets/demo), a tool I originally built for Ned Hall's introductory logic course at Harvard.

I use handouts when I want to provide an easily-navigable 'map' of the issues under discussion. Some sample handouts of mine:

ALTERNATIVE TEXT:

I use handouts when I want to guide students' attention, to provide an easily-navigable 'map' of the issues under discussion. Handouts should be carefully constructed to:

- Highlight questions/problems and avoid spoon-feeding students over-simplified summaries of the material.
- Allow for self-guided reflection by giving the students the freedom to linger on points of interest, to jump back/look ahead.
- Obviate rote note-taking, making it easier for students to think critically about the material as it's being presented.
- Make it easier to jump in and out of group discussion by providing everyone with a static, shared point of reference for important quotes, key claims, and discussion questions.

Some sample handouts of mine:
