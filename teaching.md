# Teaching Tools & Materials

I grade student papers anonymously using an online tool I built, [Paper Grader](http://papergrader.org/demo).

I create interactive practice problems for my logic students at [deductivelogic.org](http://deductivelogic.org/psets/demo), a tool I originally built in coordination with Ned Hall, for his introductory logic course at Harvard.

I use handouts to provide an easily-navigable 'map' of the issues under discussion, and to help guide student attention. Some sample handouts of mine:

ALTERNATIVE TEXT:

I use handouts when I want to guide students' attention, to provide an easily-navigable 'map' of the issues under discussion. Handouts should be carefully constructed to:

- Highlight questions/problems and avoid spoon-feeding students over-simplified summaries of the material.
- Allow for self-guided reflection by giving the students the freedom to linger on points of interest, to jump back/look ahead.
- Obviate rote note-taking, making it easier for students to think critically about the material as it's being presented.
- Make it easier to jump in and out of group discussion by providing everyone with a static, shared point of reference for important quotes, key claims, and discussion questions.

Some sample handouts of mine:

	<div class="item-description"> <p>An introduction to the central questions in philosophy of mind, divided into three parts: 1) Historical Foundations, 2) Consciousness, 3) Cognition and Representation. What kinds of things are mental states (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, desires, sensations, feelings)? Is the mind just the brain? (What else could it be?!) Can a science of the brain answer all of our questions about the mind? What is consciousness, and how is it related to the physical world? How is the mind able to represent the world and reason about it?</p></div>
