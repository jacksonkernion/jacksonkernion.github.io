# Tools

I try to keep up a coding hobby by building tools for myself and for other academics.

**Paper Grader**
This is a simple tool that helps streamline the paper-grading process. Students submit their papers at a unique assignment URL, teacherspaper mark up these is done via a clean online interface, and all graded papers can be returned with one click.

**GSI Assigner**
As part of an effort by the Berkeley grad students to improve on the way graduate student instructors (GSIs) were assigned to courses, I put together a website that collects teaching preferences and recommends optimal, stable assignments (using an algorithm inspired by work on the stable marriage problem).

**deductivelogic.org**
I built this for Harvard's introductory deductive logic class. Teachers can create interactive problem sets that automatically check students work.
